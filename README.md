# Argumentation-Mining
Argumentation Mining Project for course Machine Learning and Content Analytics

# Intuitive_baseline_model.ipynb file 
presents the baseline model that was created and used as a measure of comparison

# Classification_Fasttext_Approach_Arguments.ipynb file 
presents the classification models for the arguments of the article ids created using the FastText algorithm

# Classification_Fasttext_Approach_Structure.ipynb file 
presents the classification models for the structure of the article ids created using the FastText algorithm

# Clustering_Graph_Claim_Evidence.ipynb file 
presents the clustering model for claim + evidence arguments of the articles ids created using Graphs and NetworkX library

# Clustering_Graph_Claim_only.ipynb file 
presents the clustering model only for claim arguments of the articles ids created using Graphs and NetworkX library


# Rest files
#### datasets.7z file contains all datasets used for the project
#### Fasttext_inputs(train_validation_test).7z file contains all .txt files that were created in order to be used as input and test with the correct format required by FastText algorithm
#### final classification models that were created using FastText for both arguments and structure are available at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sOhtG7tBMGE47n7wPcrmn3YS3VbKkJlH?usp=sharing



# final_report.pdf file
